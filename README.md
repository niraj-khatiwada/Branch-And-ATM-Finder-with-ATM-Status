# Branch and ATM finder with ATM Status Check- Full Stack Application

This application helps to find different branches of banks by their location, see total number of ATM's in that particular branch along with their status(i.e. Working or Not Working) as well as different ATM's that are independent of branches with their statuses too.

NOTE: The number of ATM's in a branch and their statuses is arbitrary. These information are only known to banks particularly the ATM status. Nevertheless the project can display if there's someway to have that information. Currently its unknown so its only a mockup.
